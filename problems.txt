-> i was facing difficulty when i was implementing info hash as it needed me to get bencoded string from the json thatI made in the
 previous setp of parsing the torrent initially as I had converted my torrent file into json object i thought I can just use the str 
 function of json but it is not built to handle raw binary data it can only handle utf8 so I then converted json object to a std::string 
 and then bencoded it and calculated sha1 hash of that value
